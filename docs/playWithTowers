Fun things to test xml parser:

Tower.m line 36
	change level_ = to anything 1-4
	
Level.m line 95
	change withTower:@"stone" to:
		stone
		fire
		lightening
		ice
		

right now the only thing the tower is really implementing is damage and speed, so feel free to play around with those properties in the xml file (./code/Tower Defense/Resources/data/towers.xml)
